# Healthcare-analysis

Disclaimer - This was part of my bachelor degree thesis therefore it is actually in czech. There are still some insights someone could get from the code part.

In this analysis we use a healthcare dataset to create risk prediction model for stroke. We clean the data and create basic graphs to gather insights from them. First model we try is a decision tree model which does not get us good results. We create a random forrest model which is way better in the end.
